			<h1>About Rainydays</h1>
			<p>
				Rainydays has over 20 years' experience with hiking clothing
				adapted to Nordic conditions. By placing emphasis on design and
				practical solutions, Rainydays has developed hiking clothing
				that allows everyone to be well dressed on small and large trips
				in all kinds of weather. The hiking clothes from Rainydays are
				sold at friendly prices. It shouldn't cost too much to get out
				on a trip together. Ever since its inception in 1998, Rainydays
				has taken a major social responsibility. 25% of all those
				recruited must be people who normally end up outside the
				workforce. Rainydays was the first sports and textile wholesaler
				to be included in the Initiative for Ethical Trade in 2002, and
				the company works continuously to reduce the climate and
				environmental impact associated with the business.
